## Overview

![screenshot](https://ik.imagekit.io/d3kzbpbila/chat-siris-v2_BzbM_L4HM.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1669656844801)


- This project was an upgraded version of previous work [chat-siris-v1](https://chat-siris-v1.vercel.app) , in previous Version text , image and audio sharing feature only will be possible. New version of chat-siris is capable of sharing all type of multimedias (including images, videos, audios, text document, pdf, word, ppt, coding files(html,css,js,php,etc..) , zip files etc... ) . Comparing with previous version the loading speed will be comparitively faster even in low network speed. 
  
  The main advantage of chat-siris-v2 is, it is capable of sharing all type of media formats within seconds , and it can be shared to many users and the files will be always there in channel chat box , so anyone can download the file at any time. Simply each time you send a file or any type of media to any channel it will be sent to out database and will be stored there permanently (admin of channel can delete a message from the channel at any time) and will be available to all the users. 

- My personal experience while developing this site, learnt about socket in deep and how to handle all type of media formats using imagekit.io
